## Create PR Workflow

### 1. PR Title Format

- **Format**: `[<jira-issue-number>] <jira issue title>`
- **Example**: `[SXS-1227] Add shadow traffic support for metrics endpoint`
- Use the original Jira issue title unless it doesn't represent the changes well
- Always include `[<jira-issue-number>]` at the beginning

### 2. PR Description

Check for repo template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and follow it.

Otherwise, include:
- Summary of changes
- Link to Jira ticket
- Note that PR was generated by Claude with the plan followed
- Testing instructions if applicable

### 3. Create the Draft PR

**Always create PRs as drafts** using the `--draft` flag.

Use `gh pr create` with heredoc for clean formatting:

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "PR title here" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<summary here>

## Jira
<jira link>

## Notes
Implementation by Claude Code following the approved plan.
EOF
)"
```

### 4. Return PR URL

Display the PR URL to the user when complete.
