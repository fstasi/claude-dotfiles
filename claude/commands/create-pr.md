## Create PR Workflow

### 1. PR Title Format

- Format: `[<jira-issue-number>] <jira issue title>`
- Example: `[SXS-1227] Add shadow traffic support for metrics endpoint`
- Prefer the original Jira issue title, but if it's not representative of the changes prompt suggesting a better name
- Always include the `[<jira-issue-number>]` at beginning of the PR title

### 2. PR Description

- If the repo has a PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`), follow it. Otherwise include a summary of the change and the link to Jira ticket
- Always add note that the PR was generated by claude, and include the plan claude followed

### 3. Post-PR Actions

After the PR is created:
- Run `/user:monitor-ci` to monitor CI and fix any failures

## web-ui Repository (Extra Rules)

When creating a PR in the **web-ui** repository, also follow these additional rules:

### Static Hash Link Generation

After creating the PR:

1. Spawn an async subagent to wait for the static hash to be ready
2. Use the `static-hash` skill to check and retrieve the static hash
3. When ready, update the **QA section** of the PR description

**Note:** Check the Jira issue to determine if RUM changes or feature flags are involved.

#### Base URL Format

Add a link using the static hash:
```
https://app-<static-hash>.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists?p=1
```

#### RUM Changes

If the PR contains code that changes RUM, append `&enable-rum=1`:
```
https://app-<static-hash>.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists?p=1&enable-rum=1
```

#### Feature Flags

If the PR relies on a feature flag, append `&set_config_<flag-name>=true`:
```
https://app-<static-hash>.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists?p=1&enable-rum=1&set_config_sxs-shadow-traffic=true
```

## dd-source Repository (Extra Rules)

When creating a PR in the **dd-source** repository, also follow these additional rules:

### Prompt user to E2E changes

Monitor the CI using `/user:monitor-ci` and wait for it to complete with no errors.
When all the CI jobs are done and passing, prompt the user if they want to proceed with E2E testing their change.

If E2E testing is requested, run `/user:e2e-dd-source` for the full E2E testing workflow.
